I am a graduate of the Software Engineering program at Flatiron School and a current Computer Science student. With experience in Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, and JavaScript based programming and a background in banking, I became passionate about programming through my responsibilities as a Research & Product Development Analyst. I loved working on and researching technical products that give businesses competitive advantage, augmenting customer acquisition and retention and allowing businesses to better meet customer needs. But beyond business, I love learning new skills and building useful tools that simplify life. Being a web developer allows me to connect and communicate with an audience through my passion of creating technological solutions by utilizing my problem solving, logical and creative skills.
